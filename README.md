Animation - Typed text

For you to edit the typed text I put a warning:

<! - Edit the text and link here ->
In quotes (") is the description of the link followed by a space a comma and the url in quotes ("), like this:

["descrição", "url"]

To insert more links, after each bracket, you must give space followed by a comma and space to open new brackets.

You can increase or decrease the space where the text will be presented by:

var container_size = 425;

Where 425 is the current size and can be smaller or larger according to what you want
